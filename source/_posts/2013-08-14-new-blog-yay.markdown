```ruby Fake test class
class Test
  def hey
    puts hey
  end
end
````

{% blockquote Jake Craige, His Playful Self %}
And heeerreee. Is a gist!
{% endblockquote %}

{% gist 6227391 %}

{% codeblock lang:php %}
echo "Well this is all about them tests!";
{% endcodeblock %}

{% pullquote %}
Well i don't really have anything to write here but i wanted to use the
pullquote as they request of me. {" I am magic "} I told them. But no one
believed me. It was so sad that this happend like that. Well, I'm excited about
this new blog. Yay ruby and rails? hah. DUHH yay!
