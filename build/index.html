  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;m sure the majority of developers out there have heard of Vim. I&rsquo;m also sure
that most of you are frightened by it. <em>No offense</em>. I suppose you have good
reasons for that.</p>

<h3>Let&rsquo;s recreate the first time you encountered vim..</h3>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='&#8220;THIS EDITOR SUCKS&#8221; you say to yourself.'>
You get access to your first remote box and locate the file you want to edit. So
you google how to edit it and you discover this program valled &ldquo;Vim&rdquo;.
Excited to use this new program you type in vim filename.ext and it opens up
the file and you see the content. &ldquo;Yay!!&rdquo; you say to yourself. Then you attempt
to use the mouse to go to where you want to edit and click.. &ldquo;Hmm.. it&rsquo;s not
working..&rdquo; then you try to type in some letters to make sure you can at least do
that. click click click.. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not working either! what is wrong with this
program!!&rdquo;. Shortly after this frustration you realize that you can use the
arrow keys to move around and after a quick google you can insert text after
clicking &lsquo;i&rsquo;. At this point you can move around and edit files but you&rsquo;re having
a terrible time. &ldquo;THIS EDITOR SUCKS&rdquo; you say to yourself.
</span></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, we&#8217;e all been there. I would venture to say no one likes Vim the
first time they open it up.</p>

<blockquote><p>Here is my current monster of a .vimrc</p><footer><strong>@jakecraige</strong> <cite><a href='https://gist.github.com/jakecraige/6236660'>gist.github.com/jakecraige/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Yikes! That&rsquo;s pretty scary! I agree, when you first lay eyes on this it looks to
be pretty wild. Though it&rsquo;s really not so bad when you start to
look through it. It&rsquo;s only a collection of alias&rsquo;s for different commands
to make life easier. While vim is powerful at it&rsquo;s basic level, adding in plugins
and custom aliases is where it really starts to shine. <em>And hey, I&rsquo;ve organized
it into folds for easy navigation.</em></p>

<h2>My Vim Journey</h2>

<p><span class='pullquote-right' data-pullquote='Slowly but surely I continued to improve until
I didn&#8217;t really want to use Sublime Text anymore. I actually had more typos in
it from hitting my Vim binds in it.'>
I had messed around with Vim a few times throughout the years and always
switched back to using a modern text editor like Sublime Text 2. It just seemed
easier, and yeah, it was, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it was the best solution for me.
About 3 or 4 months ago I read lots of articles and setup a vimrc and began to
actively using vim as my primary text editor. At work I still used Sublime Text
2 so as to not slow me down, and at home I would use Vim and continued to get
better. After a few weeks I felt pretty confident in using it and set it up on
the computer at work as well. Slowly but surely I continued to improve until
I didn&rsquo;t really want to use Sublime Text anymore. I actually had more typos in
it from hitting my Vim binds in it. It starts to become muscle memory after
awhile and you just can&rsquo;t stop. You just get that itch to hit &rsquo;ll the time!!
(more on that later) I am constantly updating my vimrc with new things that
would be helpful and have completely changed it multiple times throughout this
experience. At first I was using spf13&rsquo;s vim setup and that was good for awhile
but seemed to run slower than I wanted it to and included things I didn&rsquo;t want
to use so I got rid of it. Now I have a complete custom vimrc (lots stolen from
others) but one that I have put together so it works best for me. It takes time
to get to learn to use Vim but I think it&rsquo;s worth it.
</span></p>

<h2>Now that I&rsquo;ve scared you a bit. Let&rsquo;s get to it!</h2>

<p>First step, open up terminal and type in &lsquo;vimtutor&rsquo;.(minus the quotes). Run
through that tutorial to get a basic understanding of how to move around the
file and edit things. That alone will help you start to see some of it&rsquo;s power.
I haven&rsquo;t used this site, but it seems very similar to vimtutor but a bit more
interactive so you could give it a shot as well

<p>After that it&rsquo;s time to start setting up a vimrc.</p>

<p>Ugh. I&rsquo;ll continue this later. If anyone comes upon it before then, these helped
me get started.</p>
