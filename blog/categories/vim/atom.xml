    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m sure the majority of developers out there have heard of Vim. I&rsquo;m also sure
that most of you are frightened by it. <em>No offense</em>. I suppose you have good
reasons for that.</p>

<h3>Let&rsquo;s recreate the first time you encountered vim..</h3>

<p>Surround your pullquote like this {" text to be quoted "}</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry, we'e all been there. I would venture to say no one likes Vim the
first time they open it up.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Here is my current monster of a .vimrc</p><footer><strong>@jakecraige <a href="https://gist.github.com/jakecraige/6236660">https://gist.github.com/jakecraige/6236660</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Yikes! That&rsquo;s pretty scary! I agree, when you first lay eyes on this it looks to
be pretty wild. Though it&rsquo;s really not so bad when you start to
look through it. It&rsquo;s only a collection of alias&rsquo;s for different commands
to make life easier. While vim is powerful at it&rsquo;s basic level, adding in plugins
and custom aliases is where it really starts to shine. <em>And hey, I&rsquo;ve organized
it into folds for easy navigation.</em></p>

<h2>My Vim Journey</h2>

<h2>Now that I&rsquo;ve scared you a bit. Let&rsquo;s get to it!</h2>

<p>First step, open up terminal and type in &lsquo;vimtutor&rsquo;.(minus the quotes). Run
through that tutorial to get a basic understanding of how to move around the
file and edit things. That alone will help you start to see some of it&rsquo;s power.
I haven&rsquo;t used this site, but it seems very similar to vimtutor but a bit more
interactive so you could give it a shot as well

<p>After that it&rsquo;s time to start setting up a vimrc.</p>

<p>Ugh. I&rsquo;ll continue this later. If anyone comes upon it before then, these helped
me get started.</p>
